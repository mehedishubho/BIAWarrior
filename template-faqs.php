                    thing you can do throughout your pregnancy to stay
                    healthy and strong for and after your delivery! The
                    coaches are extremely mindful and provide individual
                    programming based on your needs and existing conditions.
                    This means that you get to train with a group of other
                    amazing women while having a program that is designed
                    specifically for you. I could go on and on about the
                    community, the impact and the coaches, but it's best to
                    say: try it and you will not regret it!

                    I've never really been one to want to go into the gym
                    and lift weights, so I was looking for something
                    different. Because of my proximal femoral focal
                    deficiency disability, I have to wear a prosthetic leg,
                    I wasn't sure if ninja training would be acceptable for
                    me. The first week was a bit scary, but after a while,
                    you get to know the coaches, who are incredible, and
                    support you the whole way through no matter what level
                    you're at. The program showed me that your body can do a
                    lot more than you think it can, no matter level or
                    ability. There's always a way of doing something. It
                    doesn't matter how fit or unfit you are, how able you
                    are, there's always a way if you want to do it. Bia
                    Warrior is an amazing program to join, and the coaches
                    are amazing. It's the most exciting, fun, challenging,
                    inspiring, motivating, life-changing program I've ever
                    been a part of. There are some days I've come out of the
                    sessions and cry because I'd achieved something I never
                    thought was possible. It's all because of the Bia
                    Warrior coaches and community. All women should join
                    this program. You will get out of it so much more than
                    fitness. It's about community, about encouraging each
                    other and supporting each other to overcome something
                    and to be your best.

                    Great community. Very supportive. It's actually changed
                    my life & my perspective on fitness & strength. I can
                    say I'm much stronger now, both mentally & physically.
                    But the people? They're the best part!! The coaches are
                    the best in the industry & the other members are just
                    wonderful. Getting into Bia Warrior is like a life hack,
                    you get everything you need all wrapped up in a bow tie
                    ribbon.
